# 100DaysOfCSS
Some of my pens for 100 days of css challenge. Made with Pure CSS and HTML.

## Problem No 71

### LINK

* [Code Pen Link](https://codepen.io/rakeshmty/pen/WmJmvG)

### OBSERVATIONS
* To check how the pen works just press any button (A-Z,0-9) until and unless you dont see the dot blinking.
* I thought of using a continuous press event rather than a single click as you can straightaway start with a new button without waiting for the existing button animation to complete. Also if you are using radio click then the button will be stuck after first click so you will have to refresh the page if you want to try the same button again.
