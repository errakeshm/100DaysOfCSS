## Problem No 71

### Link

### Observations
* To check how the pen works just press any button (A-Z,0-9) until and unless you dont see the dot blinking.
* I thought of using a continuous press event rather than a single click as you can straightaway start with a new button without waiting for the existing button animation to complete. Also if you are using radio click then the button will be stuck after first click so you will have to refresh the page if you want to try the same button again.

## Problem No 77

### Link

* [Code Pen Link](https://codepen.io/rakeshmty/pen/moaNNY)

### Observations
* The problem was regarding showing a sort of ray following the ball as it moves(like that of a comet)

## Problem No 78

### Link

* [Code Pen Link](https://codepen.io/rakeshmty/pen/jJdxpE)

### Observations
* The problem was regarding scaling of the elements instead of using zoom. Zoom just expands the element thereby disturbing and causing a slight shift of rest of the buttons.
